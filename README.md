# Movie Recommendation System

This is a movie recommendation system built using Streamlit, Python, and a machine learning model to recommend similar movies based on the selected movie. The app uses movie data and a pre-trained similarity model to provide recommendations and displays movie posters fetched from an external API (OMDb API).

## Features
- Search for a movie or select one from a dropdown.
- Get recommendations for movies similar to the selected movie.
- Displays movie posters and titles.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: Framework to build the web application.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pickle**: To load pre-trained models and data (movie list and similarity matrix).
- **Requests**: To interact with the OMDb API for fetching movie posters.
